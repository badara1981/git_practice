# git_practice

- Create a repository just on your computer
- Create a git notes file in that repository
- You can edit the notes file however you want (VS Code, nano, vim, emacs, notepad....)
- Every time you make an entry into the file, make a commit
- Research the topics listed below and add a short definition of them **in your words** to the README 
  - Surface level research for now, we are not making a PHD here...
  - Commit after each one!
- Topics:
  - "What makes a good commit message"
  - "What is staging in git"
  - "How to check which version of git you have installed"
  - "What is Semantic Versioning (SemVer)"
  - "How to see previous commands I have done in Linux"
- Then add a new text file with the relevant commands that you have used doing this exercise
